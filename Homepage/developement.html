                            In fact, according to a recent “Natural Beauty Market Trends” report from the New Hope Network’s Nutrition Business Journal, the natural beauty market is rapidly growing – citing estimates that “the global natural and organic beauty market is on track to hit $19.4 billion by 2023.”
                            Plant-inspired and botanical ingredients, from charming plant-based fragrances to cannabidiol (CBD) oils, as well as strengthening argan and jojoba oils, amino acids and plant extracts are hot items in today’s market. Superfoods such as olive oil, butter, chia seeds and avocado are also popping up in hair care serums, dry shampoos and more. For example, a blend of nourishing natural oils such as meadowfoam, argan, almond, or plum, combined with mango or shea butter, are great conditioning agents to make dry, coarse hair feel soft and static-free.

                        Consumers are looking for waterless solutions that can deliver a variety of attributes from volumizing and texturizing to oil absorption. In addition to waterless staples such as dry shampoos, national brands are increasingly launching new products to treat specific hair care issues, as well as reinventing shampoos and conditioners into cubes, powders and bars, alternatively packaged in recyclable cardboard or aluminum to reduce the use of both water and plastic.

From hair growth serums to anti-aging treatments, hairceuticals offer targeted solutions for various hair issues.
 
                        What do we mean by “science-backed” products?
                         
                        It means that these products are developed based on scientific studies and use innovative technologies. From hair repair treatments to advanced hair color formulations, science-backed products provide effective solutions based on evidence and research.
                         
                        This is the secret of their success: with advancements in hair research, science-backed products are gaining more and more credibility, and consumers are more aware of what’s inside their products and can concretely understand the effect they have on hair.
